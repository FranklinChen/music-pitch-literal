# music-pitch-literal

This package allow you to write the pitches of standard notation as expressions
overloaded on result type. This works exactly like overloaded numbers and strings.

This is a separate package so that container types can declare lifted instances without depending on `music-pitch`.

This library is part of the Haskell Music Suite, see <http://music-suite.github.io>.
